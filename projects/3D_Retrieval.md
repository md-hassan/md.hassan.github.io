<h4> Work in progress </h4>

We plan on using textual descriptions and optional hand-drawn sketches to perform multi-modal 3D model retrieval. We leverage the recently proposed <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">CLIP model</a> to find a joint embedding space for all three data modalities (image, sketch, and text). We are mainly referencing <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03354.pdf">this paper</a> and plan on building on top of the work.
